Tool: SilkTide Browser Extension

Pros
- Has many simulators.
- Simulators have options to adjust the experience. For example, the blindness simulator has an option for enabling "curtains" which black out the website being tested. 
This enhances the experience since the tester cannot skim the contents along with the screen reader, giving the tester an example of what it would be like to experience the website while having no vision.

Cons
- Simulations may not be 100% accurate. Ironically the color blindness 'Green greatly reduced' option turned the picture of red roses green.
- Extension can only be used in Google Chrome.

On a side note, using the dyslexia simulator on my code in glitch was scary.

Tool: NVDA

Pros
- Free version available to use on Windows.
- Easy download.
- Settings include many options to enhance the user experience, such as voice configurations, screen curtains, etc.

Cons
- Difficulty reading text in file contents when editing. Requires mouse to be hovering over sentence or have the sentence be selected to have NVDA read it, which will be difficult for users with little to no vision.
- Selection indicator and other prefrerences need to be activated manually in setting rather than having it set up after download.
