- Unsure if your choice of html/css will work with email clients? ==> https://www.caniemail.com/ (Links to an external site.) 
- Again for this HW I'm only expecting purely structural html and css. No JavaScript functionality at the moment. 
- Majority of your css will be inline. No external css. 
- I added a screenshot of an example email one might send. Take note of the centering on certain areas. Location is in the glitch assets area.
