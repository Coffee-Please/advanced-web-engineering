# Project 4: LearnYouNode

- Finish all the [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) (Links to an external site.) exercises.
- Follow the hints provided and get familiar with the [Nodejs documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/index.html) (Links to an external site.)
- Your grade will heavily depend on using comments to explain your implementations to someone familiar with JavaScript but unfamiliar with Node.js
- Some students had issues installing node and learnyounode on their machines. For that reason here is a [glitch link](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/comp-584-learnnode) (Links to an external site.) that you can also use to complete your assignment. Make sure to remix it so that you have your own version of the project.
