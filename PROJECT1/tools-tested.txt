Litmus: Website and Chrome Extension

Notes:

Litmus requires an account to be made to view more formats.
The emails generated are images, so links and buttons are not interactive.
Litmus has many useful features, checks and testing reports generated.
There is a NVDA Screen Reader preview with a transcript, image blocking preview, accessibility audits, etc.
Text aligned or justified center fails an accessibility audit.


Email: Gmail, Gmail App (Android)
On the first try, I sent the email to myself using my college email (Gmail). 
Upon opening the email, this is what I observed:
- The slides disappered.
- Links and images are now unresponsive.
- Text and columns are responsive in mobile layout.


Email: Outlook (Windows 10)
- The slides disappered.
- Radio input format was off, showing "(X)()()" in place of radio buttons and striping the labels of their CSS makung them seem like plaintext.
- Outlook 2016: Two column format is off, the image size reset pushes the second column below the first.
- Logo CSS removed, the size and border radius has been resetted.


Email: Outlook (macOS)
- Image generated layout looks as expected.


Email: Apple Mail 12, 13 Dark, 13
- Image generated layout looks as expected.

iPad, iPhone
- Image generated layout looks as expected.

Email: Yahoo, AOL Mail
- Logo is huge. Retains styling but size was reset.
- Default radio buttons are visible, all slides are displayed at once.
